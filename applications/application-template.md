### Overview

The part Decentralized MemeFlate2.0 platform is essentially a freelance marketplace for digital and local services. The marketplace acts as a medium, offering Freelancers, buyers and visitors a unique experience that is designed to gain more user interaction whilst browsing and open the world to mass adoption of payments made in cryptocurrencies with a diverse eco-system of token with relatable utilities for the everyday person.

The MemeFlate project, all though heavily developed on the BSC network lacks the support from the network itself in assisting develop smaller projects such as MemeFlate. By building and completing the project on the VeChain network MemeFlate would gain, support, much needed resources, and a chance to network with relevant projects and platforms.

## Are there any other projects similar to yours? If so, how is your project different?

There are similar crypto based project to the MemeFlates freelance marketplace, but they are few and far between, the more traditional platforms that provide some of the same services are all world leading and thus seen as an aspiration/competition to the project.

MemeFlate strives to be different in many ways ranging from but not limited to the following:

A Facebook type community centre, allowing users to, build profiles, add friends, send gifs/videos/photos and post updates, this allows buyers, freelancers and users to interact with each other, building a level of trust and community among all the platforms users.

MemeFlate focuses on user interaction to attract not only freelancers and cryptocurrency enthusiast but the everyday person too, MemeFlate achieves this by offering a wide range of easy to use and relatable web3 Dapps to accompany the marketplace use case. MemeFlate will become the platform of choice when it comes to freelancers and how they receive cryptocurrency payments plus gain access to utilities like, Auto staking, Optional staking, NFTs, NFT-Staking, Rewards, Game-Fi, Social-Fi and more.

As the cryto space and its projects are community driven, MemeFlate aims to be inclusive of those who wish to take part in the project and find ways to help people earn a living, one of the concepts implemented is its merchandise store, this store is open to community and marketplace users to design2earn (d2e) by submit designs for merch in which they can earn the profits if sold.

MemeFlate eliminates the need to charge any commission to a freelancers or buyer compared to other more notable platforms by providing optional Web3 utilities in which the platform can earn an income and support its own growth (0 commission Platform).
Unlike similar platforms, MemeFlate can also reduce its withdrawal times for freelancers by up to 80%, giving them access to funds when they need them the most.

MemeFlate would like to be innovative by also offering 'local services' in which where a seller of goods in one parts of the world, can ship items, wished to be purchased in another part of the world and with MemeFlate having its inception in the crypto space it makes its reach and prediction for growth exponentially.

MemeFlate was created by a creative mind and small business owner so this can be looked at as a cutting edge with the willingness to see the project succeed.

## Future Plans

MemeFlate and its ecosystem would like to provide freelancers away to earn a little bit extra and a stable way of receiving cryptocurrncies as a payment method, by eliminating the need for the platform to charge any commission unlike its competitors and create the first 'Freelancer Stable Coin' backed by multi fiat currencies always maintaining its face value (USDT BUSD ect) the marketplace will stand out as a diverse freelance platform.
MemeFlate aims to make this stable innovative by creating a swap aggregator that allows a buyer/user of the platform to trade in any crypto currency, and in return receive the freelance stable coin, this coin is then used to pay freelancers who can then decide to trade it in for other crypto/fiat currencies or stake the coin to receive competitive APR%, gifts and access stable coin related products. With the expansion of the marketplace, it would hope to secure substantial partnerships with reputable organization to back the platform thus giving freelance more ways to save/earn/ reason to use the platform and use their stable coins cross the open market. (This stable coin should be able to be purchased by using Debit card, PayPal and the swap)

## Example of a integrated swap feature built in to the site, this is how the 'freelance stable coin' will function)
